## Goal (What I Tried to Achieve)
- Crisp target state; success criteria

## Initial Hypothesis & Constraints
- Why this should work; assumptions; time/budget/hardware limits

## Attempts & Iterations (Chronological)
- **T0** — approach, commands/configs, expected vs actual  
- **T1** — pivot based on evidence  
```bash
# repro commands or script fragments
```
## Dead ends and eliminated hypotheses

## Evidence
- Logs, traces, benchmarks, screenshots (with captions)

## Analysis
- What the evidence implies; threats to validity

## Result
- Achieved / Partially achieved / Not achieved, with reasons

## Lessons Learned
- Reusable insights and anti-patterns

## Next Moves
- Experiments, metrics, decision gates

## Appendix
- Raw notes, datasets, links to artifacts
